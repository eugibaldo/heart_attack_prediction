# heart attack prediction

This project deals with heart attack prediction by using data available on kaggle at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset).
there are over 300 observations with patient features (e.g. blood pressure) and a binary target variable, which takes 0 if the patient has less chance of an heart attack and 1 if it is more likely to happen.
the repository is composed by the following items:
<ul>
  <li>heart_attack_prediction.ipynb. a jupyter notebook where it is possible to observe the results.</li>
  <li>modules. a folder which contains preprocessing.py and visualization.py files. These files are utilities used in the main notebook to perform feature preprocessing and data visualization.</li>
  <li>datasets. folder which contains the heart.csv dataset.</li>
  <li>plots which display feature distribution, correlation and association heatmaps, feature importance.</li>
 </ul>
